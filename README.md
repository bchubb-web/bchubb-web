### bchubb-web

 A developer who aims to make his and others lives easier, many of my projects and gists are tools i use to automate or aid with boring tasks

I'm currently working on a PHP framework with similarities to NextJS 13 called [phntm (phantom)](https://github.com/bchubb-web/phntm), implementing features such as file system based routing and dynamic routes.

Looking to move to lower level development and are currently learning c++ (god help me) and trying to better understand memory management.


I use vim btw.
