### bchubb-web

 A developer who aims to make his and others lives easier, many of my projects are tools i use to automate or aid with tasks i find boring or slow me down.

## PHP
I'm currently working on a PHP framework similar to NextJS 13 called [phntm](https://github.com/bchubb-web/phntm), with features like file system based routing and dynamic and type-safe routes. 
I am also building an extensible OAuth token manager - [Toucan](https://github.com/bchubb-web/toucan) as a composer package, for easy integration for long lived sessions without manually refreshing or reauthentication. 

## C++
I have a couple of projects in C++, which i am trying to become more adept at, as i want to gain a deeper understanding of programming, for this i am building a terminal based [text editor](https://github.com/bchubb-web/scripture) like vim, aswell as a few command line tools.


I use vim btw.
