## âœ¨ About Me
 As a developer, i aim to make people's lives easier, i develop a variety of tools i use in my daily workflow, and i have worked within company intranets creating tools to automate and streamline their management and tasks

## PHP
I am currently learning Laravel, and working on a few projects, a storage management system called Kibisis which will be available at some point in the future, and a lightweight intranet platform intended for easy setup with an easy to use interface and a variety of tooling build into it.
I am also building an extensible OAuth token manager - [Toucan](https://github.com/bchubb-web/toucan), for easy integration for long lived sessions without manually refreshing or reauthentication. 

## C++
I have a couple of projects in C++, which i am trying to become more adept at, as i want to gain a deeper understanding of programming, for this i am building a terminal based [text editor](https://github.com/bchubb-web/scripture) like vim, as well as a few command line tools.
